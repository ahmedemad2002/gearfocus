This camera is still one of the best out there for wildlife photography and is still recognised as one of the best DLSR Cameras Canon bought out. Built for speed and durability it has never let me down. Whether in Camera or Video mode, the Canon 7D Mkii delivers\n\nI moved up to the Canon 1 DX Mkii last year and will be going mirrorless shortly, therefore this excellent camera is surplus to requirements and ready for a new home. You can literally take this out of the box (and the original protective wrapping), add your lens of choice, add the batteries and grip, slide in the compact flash cards and start shooting to your heart's content.\n\nThis camera has been well looked after\n\nTech Spec provided by Canon\n\nBuilt for those with a love of speed. Capture the extraordinary, and grab the moments that other photographers miss. Whether it’s stills or movies, express your creative side \n\nShoot bursts of images at up 10 frames per second, with full autofocus and auto exposure. Responsive handling means you'll capture the split-second moment you are chasing, and a generous buffer lets you keep shooting without a drop in performance\n\nThe EOS 7D Mark II uses Dual \"DIGIC 6\" image processors to deliver a responsive performance. Minimal lag time when shooting means you'll capture fleeting moments with precision timing.\n\n65-point wide-area autofocus\nFor pin-sharp focus while you shoot EOS 7D Mark II has 65 focus points track fast moving subjects. Each focus point is a 'cross-type'* meaning it can lock on to both horizontal and vertical detail quickly and accurately. To assist shooting in extreme low light conditions 7D Mark II can focus even under moonlight conditions where light levels can be as low as -3EV.\n* Number of available AF point, cross-type points and Dual Cross-type AF points vary depending on the lens\n\nFrom wildlife to motor sports to street photography, and 20.2-megapixel sensor delivers results you'd be proud to see on the wall. Even in poor lighting the EOS 7D Mark II delivers photos and movie clips that are packed with detail. From the street to the studio, the EOS 7D Mark II performs in every photographic situation. Its speed and precision make it ideal for sport and action, while its low light capabilities and built-in GPS make it a great choice for those who like to travel and engage wit the surrounding scenery capturing pictures to remember for a lifetime \nWeather sealing\nWhen conditions take a turn for the worse, carry on shooting with confidence. Weather-sealed controls protect the EOS 7D Mark II against water and dust, and magnesium alloy construction adds durability.\n\nBuilt-in GPS\nThe EOS 7D Mark II can geotag images and movie clips with your exact position wherever you are in the world. Record longitude, latitude, elevation and compass direction as well as coordinated universal time\n\nHigh dynamic range (HDR) mode\nWhen shooting in high-contrast conditions, HDR shooting helps preserve detail in dark shadows and bright highlights. In quick succession the EOS 7D Mark II captures three images at different exposures and blends them together for a natural-looking result straight from the camera\n\nDual memory card slots\nThe EOS 7D Mark II has dual memory card slots, enabling automatic back up of files as you shoot, and extended storage capacity.\nThis camera also won the TIPA Product Award 2015 and the EOISA Award of Best product 205-16 \n\nPrice at current USD to £ Stirling $990 or £800\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/canon-7d-mkii-and-bundle-T3FdI"},

Shoots 4K 24/30P. There are a few little quirks that make this quite a unique camera to shoot with, mainly being the back LCD screen is cracked. Despite this crack, it works perfectly and doesn’t affect visual quality. Basically just a way to get the same camera for cheaper. The autofocus might as well not exist, the 20mm lens is not compatible with continuous Video-AF, and the Tamron lens while very sharp, versatile, and compatible with Continuous AF- has the loudest autofocus motor I’ve ever heard. It’s really something to behold. This camera has Panasonic’s class leading In-Body Image Stabilization, it is legitimately some of the smoothest footage you will ever see without a gimbal. Given that this is a Micro Four-Thirds camera, the crop factor vs full frame equivalents is considerable adding up to about 2.4x when shooting in 4K. Despite its micro 4/3 sensor, it is actually decently capable in low light.\n\nAll this comes together to create a lovely, surprisingly tiny little camera rig that lasts around a day and a half off one charge. This is a great camera for someone looking to get into cinema-style video, emphasizing learning the art of manual focus and run and gun video. I’m including a right angle Micro-HDMI to full size HDMI converter because Micro-HDMI ports are notoriously easy to break, so this alleviates some of the strain of plugging and unplugging it, plus it is protected from hits by the cage. Im also including the “eBay supreme” hdmi capture card. It accepts 4K 60P signals and down-converts them to 1080P thru USB so you can use it as a webcam for streaming.\n\nThe concept of this package is to be as versatile as possible while remaining as tiny as possible. This includes *everything* you need to start filmmaking.\n\nPackage includes:\nLUMIX GX85\nCamvate Universal Camera Cage\nLUMIX 20mm f1.7 with Fotoga Variable ND filter\nViltrox EF-M2 II 0.71x Focal Reducer\nTamron SP AF 17-50mm F2.8\nLUMIX GX85 Battery\nLUMIX GX85 USB Dummy Battery\nAndycine Sony NPF battery plate\nNo-name Sony NPF Battery\nSandisk Extreme Pro 64GB SD Card\nRight-Angle Micro HDMI to HDMI cable with coupler\neBay supreme HDMI Capture Card", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/panasonic-lumix-gx85-2-lenses-speedbooster-and-more-full-kit-Jz2Ef"},

The camera operates perfectly and I am only selling because I am upgrading. This camera provides amazing picture quality, stabilization, and reliability. \n\nI babied this camera from the moment I received it. You can see from the pictures it comes with the original items: box, instruction manual (never opened and never registered), shoulder strap, one DMW-22 black battery, battery charger (not shown in picture but included), body cap, and hotshoe cover.\n\nWhat I love about this camera is the awesome Panasonic colors. It made my videos look like movies with just a little color grading in post. This camera also uses shutter angle, which is very useful. The menu system is super simple and the buttons can be customized for very quick transitions to any settings you want. \n\nThe Lumix S5 also has a dual card slot so you will never lose footage. This camera has never overheated even when using it for an hour straight at 4K. It is also capable of shooting at 6k with an Atmos Ninja (external recorder). This camera is on par with the best Sony cameras for awesome night-time shooting in low light conditions with its full-frame sensor.\n\nThe camera has very minimal wear, as you can see in the photos. You will not be disappointed in this purchase. I always take top care of all my gear. Please note this camera does not come with memory cards or lenses.  \n\nBelow is some more information about the camera. If you have any questions about the camera, please contact me.

Nikon's superior image processor has been updated to EXPEED 5 to harness the power of this remarkable new sensor, and a second processor has been added just for autofocus. All of the exquisite detail and textures, vibrant colors and rich tonality delivered by NIKKOR lenses is captured in flawless precision, even in extreme low light.\n\nStay On Top Of Your Game\nThe speed to capture decisive moments\nWhen you hear the D5 shooting at full speed—12 fps with fulltime AF and AE, 14 fps with fixed focus and AE with mirror up—you know the game has changed. For the first time in a Nikon DSLR, a second processor is dedicated solely to autofocus operation and computing. A new shutter and mirror sequencing mechanism nearly eliminates blackout time and mirror slap for bright, consistent views during high-speed capture. EXPEED 5 and a high performance buffer handle up 200 NEF (RAW) and/or Large JPEG images during one high-speed burst—enough to cover an entire 100m sprint without taking your finger off the shutter release button. The new 180K RGB Advanced Scene Recognition System pulls it all together and ensures every shot has optimal exposure.\n\nCapture Images That Defy The Odds\nNikon's fastest, most accurate AF system yet.\nThe D5 ushers in a new era of autofocus with the Multi-CAM 20K AF sensor module. It uses 153 focus points with 99—yes 99—cross-type sensors and a fully dedicated AF processor, and it works in near darkness (EV -4). Small subjects moving at high speed, even in low light, can be tracked with remarkable precision. The system is configurable in 153-, 72- and 25-point coverage when used with Continuous AF. All 153 points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central points work with an effective aperture of f/8. Whether you're shooting a high-speed race or A-listers on the red carpet, the D5 has you covered.\n\nMoviemaking Flexibility\n4K UHD video in light others wouldn't dare\nFor the first time in a full-frame Nikon DSLR, record 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) video with dot-by-dot readout for maximum image quality. Capture 3840 x 2160 at 30/25/24p with an angle of view approx. 1.5x lens focal length, or record Full HD 1080 video at 60/30/24p. Shoot stunning 4K UHD Time-lapse, right in camera. Auto ISO handles smooth lighting transitions from ISO 200 to the sensitivity of your choice (all the way up to Hi-5). Enjoy all the professional video capabilities of D4S and D810—simultaneous external and internal recording, Flat Picture Control, Zebra Stripes, a built-in stereo microphone with 20-step increment adjustments and so much more. Combine the D5's low light capabilities and the versatility of NIKKOR lenses, and your next video project is bound to be acclaimed.\n\nA Smooth Operator\nIncorporating feedback from the field, the D5 is engineered to reduce the stress factors of shooting all day. Improved ergonomics and an expanded illuminated button layout put key controls at your fingertips. A high resolution XGA Touchscreen LCD with a smartphone-like interface makes it easy to select AF points or Spot White Balance in Live View, swipe through shots, pinch to zoom, edit file names and more. New double XQD card slots easily handle the camera's incredible burst shooting capacity and keep the buffer cleared. All of this in a light and durable magnesium-alloy body with extensive weather sealing.", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/nikon-d5-xqd-version-20-mp-digital-slr-camera-body-9yviX"},

Based on a 20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS sensor, notable image quality is possible with enhanced sensitivity for working in a range of lighting conditions. The sensor and image processor also afford quick continuous shooting up to 5 fps for working with moving subjects, as well as UHD 4K video recording at 30p for clear, high-resolution movie playback. Balancing these imaging attributes is an expansive 60x optical zoom lens that provides a 24-1440mm equivalent range, covering wide-angle to super telephoto focal lengths, and is complemented by Dual Detect Vibration Reduction to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharp handheld shooting. An ergonomic body design reminiscent of a DSLR also benefits handling, as well as the incorporation of both a 921k-dot electronic viewfinder and rear 3.0 921k-dot vari-angle LCD. For wireless sharing and remote control of the camera from a mobile device, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC is supported as well as Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. More than just a long-zoom point-and-shoot, the B700 balances both stills and video recording assets, along with intuitive handling and file sharing components.20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS Sensor\n\nA high-resolution 20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS sensor affords impressive image quality with enhanced sensitivity to benefit working in difficult lighting conditions, along with the ability to record in the NRW raw format for expanded post-production capabilities. The sensor also affords quick performance throughout the camera system, including a continuous shooting rate of up to 5 fps.\n\n60x Optical Zoom Lens\n\nA wide-ranging NIKKOR 60x optical zoom lens provides a 24-1440mm equivalent focal length range that covers wide-angle to super telephoto perspectives, and its range can effectively be doubled through the use of Dynamic Fine Zoom for a total 120x zoom magnification. Dual Detect Vibration Reduction balances this awesome length by compensating for the effects of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting. Additionally, the lens optical design incorporates extra-low dispersion glass to minimize chromatic aberrations and color fringing throughout the zoom range for cleaner, clearer image quality.\n\nUHD 4K Video Recording\n\nIn addition to stills recording, UHD 4K video recording is supported in both 30p and 25p frame rates for clips up to 8 minutes long. Face-priority autofocus is available during recording to maintain sharp focus on detected subjects and 5-axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction can be used to suppress the effects of camera shake that occur while moving when recording. Additionally, rounding out the movie feature-set, the built-in stereo zoom mic automatically changes directivity according to the zoom position for more refined audio quality.\n\nBody Design and Built-In Wi-Fi\n\nThe ergonomic body design resembles a DSLR and incorporates a large grip for more stable shooting.\n\nA 921k-dot electronic viewfinder is available for clear eye-level shooting, which is especially beneficial when working in bright conditions.\n\nThe rear 3.0 921k-dot LCD features a vari-angle design to support working from a range of shooting angles.\n\nAn HDMI port permits connecting the camera directly to an HDTV or 4K TV for high-resolution playback.\n\nOther Camera Features\n\nMultiple Exposure Lighten records multiple shots into one frame to creatively capture moving subjects, such as fireworks.\n\nCreative Mode options let you product artistically-refined imagery in-camera.\n\nSuperlapse movies turn a fast-paced action sequence into a fast-paced video, in-camera.\n\nStandard P/S/A/M settings afford you manual control over exposure settings.\n\nThe included EN-EL23 battery provides up to 350 shots per charge.\n\nIn-camera image editing modes: Copy, D-Lighting, Filter Effects, Quick Effects, Quick Retouch, Skin Softening, and Small Picture.\n\nLanguage support: Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Marathi, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.\n\nUPC: 018208265107\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/nikon-coolpix-b700-4k-wi-fi-digital-camera-2DXjV"},

Its compact design combined with a robust set of features makes it an ideal instrument for capturing high-resolution images and video in any light conditions.\n\nIncluded in this sale are a battery, cap, and a custom-designed Really Right Stuff (RRS) base plate specifically for the A7S II. The RRS base plate, precision-machined from solid blocks of 6061-T6 aluminum, adds to the camera's stability and prevents any twisting during use. It's completely compatible with the 1.5\" RRS Dovetail Standard and includes a custom machined 1/4\"-20 threaded, captive-style mounting screw that threads into the camera's tripod mounting socket. This modular system can be further expanded with a dedicated vertical L-component for even greater flexibility.\n\nPlease note there is a minor intermittent issue where the camera might detect something attached to the accessory shoe, but this doesn't affect the shoe's operation. Flash and microphone attachments still work flawlessly, and a simple cleaning of the metal contacts may clear up this minor glitch.\n\nThis offering presents an ideal opportunity for both professional photographers and videographers as well as enthusiasts.

I'm getting more and more into doc style work and love the image this produces but need something that can shoot in lower light conditions. \n\nThis is a rare version of this camera, featuring a lighter carbon fiber wrap which also came with increased frame rates (such as 100fps in 6K 2.41:1 and 6K 17:9 at 75fps). It also has a blacked-out front emblem which IMO looks a lot cleaner than the standard red.\n\nThe camera currently has ~1500 hours and will go up as I continue to use it while I shop around for a Gemini. I bought the camera in mid 2021 from this group with about 1200 hours on it.\n \nThe only blemishes are from the previous owner installing rods too tight to the front of the camera, creating the small circular wear as you see. Beyond that, nothing more than the normal wear on the bottom of the brain from use.\nThis camera has never let me down and I've always been blown away by its image. I have taken very meticulous care of it, cleaning the body after nearly every shoot. \n\nThe camera comes with a Canon EF mount, Wooden Camera side plate, and Skin Tone OLPF. Willing to discuss the idea of adding the V-lock expander, monitor, vmount batteries, RED Side Handle etc at additional cost. Just ask me if you're interested in anything else. I am staying in the DSMC2 network so not wanting to sell much of my kit. Could potentially put together a ready to shoot kit if it's more enticing to you.\n\nHappy to answer any questions or provide more photos if need be.\nAsking $6750 USD OBO. Buyer pays shipping, happy to split Paypal fees.

It features 14 stops of dynamic range, applicable to both raw and XAVC recording as long as S-Log is turned on, for truly filmlike rendering of highlights and shadows. The camera natively features an FZ mount and includes a PL-mount adapter.Out of the box, the F5 records 2K and HD up to 59.94p in XAVC. With the latest firmware updates installed, it will be able to record 4K raw from 1p to 60p and 2K raw from 1p to 240p to an AXS-R5 recorder, as well as 1080p 4:2:2 from 1 to 180 fps internally in XAVC. It will also be able to record SStP SR at 4:4:4 internally when you select RGB mode at 440 Mb/s instead of YUV 4:2:2. All raw recording is in 16-bit.Highly Modular DesignIn addition to the AXS-R5 recorder, a digital interface on the F5 allows for a variety of optional viewfinders. DVF-EL100 is a 0.7\" OLED viewfinder with 1280 x 720 resolution. DVF-L350 is a 3.5\" LCD viewfinder with 960 x 540 resolution, and the eyepiece flips up for direct monitoring. DVF-L700 is a 7\" LCD viewfinder with 1920 x 1080 resolution for monitoring Full HD pixel-for-pixel. Other modular components include the optional Sony shoulder rig, which features industry-standard rosettes on both sides for quick and easy attachment of third-party hand grips and other accessories.Optional AXS-R5 \"Bolt-On\" RecorderThe optional AXS-R5 recorder is designed to dock on the rear of the PMW-F5 and enables 4K and 2K resolution video recording in 16-bit raw. The AXS-R5 also facilitates high-speed frame rates of up to 120 fps in 2K raw and simultaneous raw + onboard SxS recording. The recorder uses Sony's newly developed AXSM memory cards, which are compatible with an optional USB 3.0 reader (AXS-CR1). Raw files can be screened using Sony's free raw Viewer software. (AXS-R5 is sold separately.)Native FZ-Mount and PL-Mount AdapterThe F5 is designed to accommodate a wide range of lenses. With the PL-mount adaptor, you can take advantage of acclaimed cine optics from Angénieux, Canon, Carl Zeiss, Cooke, FUJIFILM, Leica and more. Slip off the supplied PL-mount adaptor to reveal the native FZ-mount with an 18mm flange focal distance. The FZ-mount provides an interface for native FZ lenses like Sony's SCL-Z18X140 auto focus servo zoom lens or a range of adaptors for still lenses, including Canon EF, Canon FD, Nikon F, Leica M and more.Dynamic Range Rated at 14 StopsThe ability to render a range of exposure values from deepest shadows to brightest highlights is a crucial test of any digital camera. The F5 is capable of an impressive 14 stops of exposure latitude, low-light sensitivity, and low noise in the blacks. The digital sensor's dynamic range approaches that of traditional motion picture film.Long-Life Olivine Battery and Quick ChargerThe F5 supports Sony's BP-FL75 battery pack, which uses Olivine Lithium Iron Phosphate instead of conventional Lithium Ion cathodes. The result is a substantial increase in charge-discharge cycles, compared to previous Sony batteries. The Olivine battery works with Sony's BC-L90 quick charger. The camera is also compatible with Sony's BP-GL95A, GL65A, L80S, and L60S batteries, which use the BC-L70 and L160 chargers.Intuitive One-Touch InterfaceDesigned with significant input from cinematographers, the F5 features an intuitive interface for a range of controls. Instead of diving through menus, you get direct, one-touch access to key shooting parameters including frame rate, shutter speed, color temperature, ISO sensitivity, and gamma. Assignable buttons mean that your favorite adjustments are always at your fingertips.Wide Choice of ConnectionsThe F5 offers numerous connections to suit your workflow, including four HD-SDI jacks, HDMI, USB, DC-in connection, a removable XLR audio module, and a removable timecode/genlock module. The XLR inputs accept balanced analog signals, provide 48V phantom power, and will accept four channels of AES/EBU digital audio with an expected firmware upgrade.Additional Features2K raw/HD simultaneous RECUser gammaHFR full scan mode, no windowingRotary Dial enabled for audio level adjustment on sub-displayFujinon Cabrio lens support, iris control from RM controller, and REC trigger on lensSimultaneous output from SDI (four outputs total)Waveform and histogram supportSxS REC reviewSupport for mount adapter LA-FZB1/FZB2User monitor LUT created by Raw ViewerAXS Rec Review via SDI outputHFR center scan modeCenter scan mode for S16mm lensInterval recordingAES/EBU audio inputPreset Sony Look profileUser-definable clip namingEmbedded clip name meta on SDI Output", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/sony-pmw-f5-cinealta-digital-cinema-camera-TLUO9"},

You also might be tempted to try and find a body only and then part out the rest.  Please trust me from my own experience, pay a little extra for someones bundle.  Especially this one that has quality additions and gets you fully shooting right out of the gate.\n\nSo then why am I selling?  I wish I could say I was upgrading to some fancy RED Monstro or whatever the next level was...but that's not it.  I just don't have enough work anymore from clients that value a high level image.  And this camera deserves that.  And I need to parse the money out into other stuff I need.\n\nThe camera:  The camera is in great shape and has only 288 hours of runtime logged.  I could list all the awesome specs but they are located in many places and hopefully you have watched some YouTube videos running through the camera.  My favorite aspects of the camera are the 6K red raw footage which is AMAZING to work with.  The wireless camera control that is soooo good that in a pinch you could use your phone as a monitor.   The autofocus...which for me wasn't a huge game changer because I didn't have a lens set that worked well with it. But the one time I did try it, I was impressed.  The menus are straight forward and easy and the touch screen is pretty great.  if you're a major overachiever, smallhd has a monitor you can purchase that gives you camera control in a bigger format. \n\nWhat's included:\n\nThe RED KOMODO 6K body\nThe RED KOMODO RF mount body cap\nThe RED KOMODO original box\n1 X Tilta Red Komodo cage system\n1 X tilta black handle that rotates\n1 X tilta bronze-ish handle that rotates and hinges\n1 x RED digital cinema black side handle with record button\n1 X aftermarket large BP style battery \n1 X RED digital cinema brand BP style battery\n3 X aftermarket small BP style battery (great for gimbal if that's your thing or as backups)\n1 X Watson brand double BP style battery charger with wall plug and car aux adapter\n1 X Angelbird CFast card reader\n1 X Angelbird CFast 6 card holder\n2 X Angelbird CFast 512GB cards !!!!!!!!\n1 X small rig hinging monitor holder (this thing is small and super handy for a hand held run and gun set up)\n1 X V mount adapter for battery slots (if you're going full cinema style or just like your Vmounts)\n1 X tilta cage box\n1 X RED handle box \n\nIF you have ever bought a camera that needed a lot of stuff to make shooting practical, you will know how full of a package this is.  It's a no brainer.  I won't even try to estimate what this would all cost if you had to buy it.  But the cards alone with the reader and holder would be about 7-800 bucks.  The handle I bought was around 500 or more. and that's before tax.  It all adds up real fast.", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/red-komodo-6k-black-w-lots-of-extras-4xphZ"},

The internal memory core is so fast it can saturate the 10G Ethernet port to its theoretical maximum speed, even with multiple users connected.

That means it's perfect for sharing large media files between editors, colorists, audio engineers and VFX artists!\n\nThe Blackmagic Cloud Store Mini is available with 8 TB of flash memory, so you have lots of space for your files.

Plus the four M.2 cards are arranged in a parallel RAID 0 group so they can operate much faster than a single card. That ensures enough speed to keep up with the 10G Ethernet connection.

This system does not have built in memory, but has all the same features as the DJI plus Noise Cancelation built-in. \n\n - Large 9.7MM mic Capsule, capable of handling a maximum of 115dB SPL (no sonic boom, providing more possibilities when recording in loud environments), this wireless lavalier microphone for iPhone captures. With 820ft (250m) ultra-long distance transmission (in an open area, no obstacles), it allows your audience to enjoy an immersive listening experience during outdoor interviews, vlogging, and live streaming without interruption.\n\n- NOISE CANCELLATION: With its pro noise cancellation technology, the wireless lavalier microphone recognizes and reduces environmental noise, ensuring that your voice is the primary focus, eliminating distractions, and enhancing the overall quality of your recordings. Quickly switch between 3 smart scene modes (indoor, outdoor, noisy) to adapt to personal needs.\n\n- 24-HOUR BATTERY LIFE: Enjoy 8 hours of battery life from the transmitters/receiver, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. Fast charging reduces the time spent worrying about battery levels. The receiver can be charged and used at the same time.\n\n- LARGER OLED TOUCHSCREEN: The receiver features a built-in 1.15-inch OLED touchscreen for intuitive control of transmitter options, along with access to smart mode, brightness, volume.\n\n- WIDE COMPATIBILITY: The wireless lavalier microphone is designed to work seamlessly with a variety of devices. Whether you're using a PC, camera, iPhone, Android smartphone, or engaging in TikTok live streaming, this wireless microphone can connect effortlessly. The compact and lightweight transmitter (20 g/0.7 Oz) easily fits in your clothes.", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/meetsummer-x1-dual-wireless-system-hX9RH"},

Its bright f/1.4 maximum aperture excels in low-light conditions and also offers greater control over depth of field for using selective focus. The Planar type optical concept is a tried-and-true design that yields consistently high sharpness throughout the focusing range with even illumination throughout the aperture range. Also, a T* anti-reflective coating has been applied to individual elements to control lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy.Normal-length prime is designed for full-frame Canon EF-mount cameras, however can also be used with APS-C models where it will provide an 80mm equivalent focal length.Fast f/1.4 maximum aperture affords extensive control over depth of field for achieving selective focus effects and also benefits working in low-light conditions.Planar optical design affords high sharpness and consistent performance throughout the focusing range to suit photographing at a wide range of imaging scales.ZEISS T* anti-reflective coating has been applied to each lens surface to help minimize reflections and provide greater contrast and color fidelity.Manual focus design enables a minimum focusing distance of 1.5'.All-metal lens barrel and mount offers high durability and rigidity.A nine-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when working with selective focus techniques.", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/zeiss-planar-t-50mm-f14-ze-lens-for-canon-ef-69XSH"},

It provides a very fast maximum aperture of T1.5 for effective low light capture and shallow depth of field control and an 8 blade iris for attractive bokeh. Optimized for cinema and video applications, the focus and aperture control rings are outfitted with industry standard gearing, which provides an interface for working with a traditional follow focus. The aperture control ring has also been de-clicked, which enables smooth iris pulls. In addition, bright aperture and distance markings are printed on the lens barrel facing laterally to facilitate easier control by a focus puller.\n\nThe 50mm has a minimum focus distance of 1.5'. Internal focusing minimizes the effects of lens breathing, which insures a more consistent angle-of-view when adjusting focus. The lens is composed of 9 elements in 6 groups, including one aspherical element and one hybrid aspherical element to reduce aberrations. In addition, a lens multi-coating helps to improve light transmission reducing flare and ghosting. The filter thread diameter is 77mm.\n\nWith this 50mm lens, Rokinon introduces the DS series of cinema lenses, unifying their cine lenses in more than just name. Each of the DS branded lenses will offer the same alignment of their geared focus and aperture rings so that follow focus and other rig accessories won't need re-adjustment when swapping lenses. Also, each DS lens is tested to be color matched with the other lenses in the series and provide the same color and contrast when shooting video. Lastly, the lenses are marked with focusing scales on each side of the barrel for easier adjustment from either side of the camera.\n\nStandard length manual focus prime lens for Sony E mount cameras.\nFunctional as still photo lens but optimized for cinema and video shooting with geared aperture and focus rings, de-clicked aperture for smooth exposure transitions and laterally printed aperture and distance markings. \nVery fast T1.5 maximum aperture for effective low light capture and shallow depth of field.\nInternal focusing system with 9 lens elements in 6 groups.\nOne aspherical and one hybrid aspherical lens element control aberrations and improve sharpness throughout the frame.\nLens multi-coating improves light transmission and reduces flare and ghosting.\nMinimum focus distance of 1.5'\nFilter thread diameter of 77mm", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/rokinon-50mm-t15-cine-ds-sony-e-mount-ETc7l"},

It has a constant minimum aperture of f/2.8 all through the zoom range. It has an ultrasonic motor for fast, quiet focusing.\n\nThis lens is in excellent+ condition. I am the original owner and have treated it well. I used it very lightly over the years I’ve had it. It has never been dropped or subjected to any extremes. It has no dents, dings, cracks or scratches. Everything works very well. The focus, both manual and auto, is smooth and accurate. The zoom ring turns just as smoothly as when it was new. The rubber weather proofing seals are still in excellent shape and do their job keeping the weather elements out.\n\nThe glass is pristine. I always kept a UV filter over the front, and the surface of the front and rear elements are like new. Internally, there is no fogging or haze. All lens elements are crystal clear. There are a couple of extremely tiny dust bits on some internal surfaces, mostly out toward the edges. These would not have any impact on image quality.\n\nThe EW-88 lens hood is in very good shape. It still mounts on the lens and does its job. It has no breaks or cracks. However, it does have some wear on it. It has some scuffs and scratches. The front and rear end caps are in excellent condition. The LP 1319 leather pouch (I think it is leather) is in excellent shape. It is clean and has no tears.\n\nI am giving the buyer of the lens an 82mm Hoya UV filter. I always kept this on the front as protection. It is in fair shape. It has a couple nicks on the surface. These nicks are very small but could impact image quality when shooting into bright lights or the sun. I never tested this as I most always take the filter off right before shooting anyways. Because of these nicks I am giving you this filter. I put no value on this filter. It is yours to use or throw away. I will not accept returns of the UV filter, or give any credit for it. It is essentially a gift.\n\nAlso included is the lens manual and original box.\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/canon-ef-16-35mm-f28-l-ii-usm-lens-wcaps-and-lens-hood-TQ7gU"},

That's been my experience; I call it my 'Swiss Army knife' lens.  \n\nIt is lightweight, has a good focal length range, with a wide focus throw which makes it great for manual focus control.  It's very sharp and resistant to flares.  It's also amazingly rectilinear: straight lines on the edge of frame stay straight.   Though nominally a S35 lens, we put it on an FX9 with a PL adapter and found that it covers 5K; I'm sure there was some falloff but no vignetting.\n\nAs you probably know, the compromise Zeiss made with this zoom is that the stop ramps, nearly a full stop over the full range of the zoom.   For my use this is easy to work around: I think of it as a variable prime, and if I'm popping the zoom in, I can crack the iris a bit just like I adjust focus.   And the truth is that many of our favorite zooms have some exposure ramping...they just don't tell you.\n\nComes with original zoom stick and support rod, and a Tilta rod bracket. I'll even ship it in its original Zeiss box.   It fits very easily into a Pelican 1510 case.\n\nLens is in Chicago; you are welcome to check it out.

While doing so, the adapter's optics help to maximize the connected lens's apparent angle of view while providing a one-stop increase for the camera over the lens's aperture range.\n\nIf a lens intended for 35mm film or similarly-sized full-frame camera sensors is connected to a Sony E-mount camera, it would project an image larger than the camera's APS-C sized sensor was built to accept. Able to capture only the center portion of the projected image, the effective angle of view of the lens would be narrowed, creating an in-camera \"crop factor.\" This adapter condenses the light from a lens designed for 35mm film or \"full frame\" camera sensors and projects it onto a Sony E-mount camera's APS-C sensor. This allows the APS-C sensor to utilize more of the light gathered by a connected lens, which effectively reduces the crop factor while making available to the sensor an additional one stop of light for each of the lens's f/stop settings.\n\nIf a compatible lens includes autofocus, as well as camera-controlled aperture functions, this adapter is intended to allow those features to be used. Also, if an attached lens is capable of generating Exif metadata when used with a directly compatible camera, this adapter is designed to allow that information to be saved along with image files generated with a combination of the lens, a compatible Sony E-mount camera, and the adapter.\n\nThis adapter is constructed with four lens elements in four groups that are designed to provide optical clarity as well as color fidelity, and the underside of its detachable tripod foot is tapped with a 1/4\"-20 accessory thread, enabling direct attachment to tripods or quick release plates that feature 1/4\"-20 mounts. For ease of upgrading its firmware, this adapter also includes a micro-USB port.\n\nFor compatible Sony E-mount cameras that feature phase-detection and contrast-detection autofocus, a toggle switch to enable those autofocus settings with a connected Canon EF-mount lens is positioned along the side of this adapter. To properly apply a desired autofocus setting, the toggle switch selection must be made prior to placing the adapter on the camera.\n\nThis adapter is compatible with the Sony NEX-5C, C3, 5N, F3, 5R, 6, 7, FS700, VG20, and VG900 cameras.\n\nMaximizes apparent angle of view of combined camera and lens\nProvides a one-stop increase for the camera over the lens's aperture range\nFour lens elements in four groups for optical clarity as well as color fidelity\nSupports electronic communication between camera and lens to enable autofocus, on-camera aperture control, and Exif metadata generation when possible\nIntegrated toggle switch for a compatible Sony E-mount camera's phase-detection or contrast-detection autofocus setting to be applied with a connected lens\nDetachable tripod foot with 1/4\"-20 accessory thread for direct attachment to tripods or quick release plates that feature 1/4\"-20 mounts\nIn the Box\nViltrox EF-E II 0.71x Lens Mount Adapter for Canon EF-Mount Lens to Select Sony E-Mount Cameras\nFront Body Cap\nRear Body Cap\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/viltrox-ef-e-ii-071x-lens-mount-adapter-for-canon-ef-mount-l-iQ1ID"},

It is designed for rigs that position the camera directly above your shoulder, such as Zacuto's Recoil rigs. It pushes focus control forward and down for easy accessibility while also functioning as a handgrip. The kit features a Zacuto Z-Drive and Tornado Grip.\n\nThe Zacuto Z-Drive follow focus attaches to a single 15mm rod and features a 60° curve to create distance from the lens. It features a fixed 0.8 pitch gear, marking disc, and a standard accessory port for attaching the Zacuto Tornado Handgrip. The Tornado features a comfortable horn shape handle that works in tandem with the curve of the Z-Drive to serve as a handgrip for a shoulder support system. The handle rotates freely, allowing you to place your thumb and forefinger on the scalloped focus wheel and turn your whole hand to pull focus.\n\nPlease note that because of the curved design of the Z-Drive, it is not compatible with matte boxes when working shoulder mounted.\n\nPlease see the links below for more information on the various components of this kit.\n\nZacuto Z-Drive\nThe Zacuto Z-Drive is a follow focus unit designed for single-operator shoulder mounted rigs. It attaches to a single 15mm rod and features a curved design that creates space and distance from the lens. This extra space provides for more comfortable use when the camera rig is on your shoulder.\n\nThe Z-Drive is adjustable for use with a variety of lens sizes, and can be operated on either side of your rig, facing either towards the lens, or backward toward the operator for use with a standard focus whip when on a tripod or dolly. It slides onto a single 15mm rod and tightens into place with a quick-release ratcheting lever. It can also be adjusted towards and away from your lens via a red thumb screw, for use with a variety of lens diameters.\n\nThe Z-Drive has a fixed 0.8 pitch gear for connecting to your lens. For lenses that don't have 0.8 pitch gears, like most DSLR lenses, Zacuto ZipGears are available, sold separately. Also available is the Zacuto Tornado, which attaches to the Z-Drive's whip port and provides a mechanical follow focus handgrip.\n\nPlease note: The Z-Drive is not compatible with matte boxes.\n\n60° curved design\nSlender marking disc for repeatable focus pulls\nStandard accessory port for Zacuto, Chrosziel, and Arri whips / cranks\nUniversal joint and no internal gears, so it won't develop any play\nZacuto Tornado Grip for Z-Drive\nThe Tornado Grip for Z-Drive from Zacuto is a mechanical follow focus handgrip for single-operator, shoulder mounted shooting. It connects to the whip port on the Zacuto Z-Drive follow focus and provides both a handgrip for two-handed shoulder mount rigs, and a focus wheel for controlling your Z-Drive. The Tornado's comfortable horn shape works in tandem with the 60° curve of the Z-Drive and is particularly useful with Zacuto Recoil support rigs, where the camera is mounted directly over your shoulder.\n\nThe Tornado slides in the Z-Drive's whip port by pushing down on the round plunger and pushing it into the port.
