This camera is still one of the best out there for wildlife photography and is still recognised as one of the best DLSR Cameras Canon bought out. Built for speed and durability it has never let me down. Whether in Camera or Video mode, the Canon 7D Mkii delivers\n\nI moved up to the Canon 1 DX Mkii last year and will be going mirrorless shortly, therefore this excellent camera is surplus to requirements and ready for a new home. You can literally take this out of the box (and the original protective wrapping), add your lens of choice, add the batteries and grip, slide in the compact flash cards and start shooting to your heart's content.\n\nThis camera has been well looked after\n\nTech Spec provided by Canon\n\nBuilt for those with a love of speed. Capture the extraordinary, and grab the moments that other photographers miss. Whether it’s stills or movies, express your creative side \n\nShoot bursts of images at up 10 frames per second, with full autofocus and auto exposure. Responsive handling means you'll capture the split-second moment you are chasing, and a generous buffer lets you keep shooting without a drop in performance\n\nThe EOS 7D Mark II uses Dual \"DIGIC 6\" image processors to deliver a responsive performance. Minimal lag time when shooting means you'll capture fleeting moments with precision timing.\n\n65-point wide-area autofocus\nFor pin-sharp focus while you shoot EOS 7D Mark II has 65 focus points track fast moving subjects. Each focus point is a 'cross-type'* meaning it can lock on to both horizontal and vertical detail quickly and accurately. To assist shooting in extreme low light conditions 7D Mark II can focus even under moonlight conditions where light levels can be as low as -3EV.\n* Number of available AF point, cross-type points and Dual Cross-type AF points vary depending on the lens\n\nFrom wildlife to motor sports to street photography, and 20.2-megapixel sensor delivers results you'd be proud to see on the wall. Even in poor lighting the EOS 7D Mark II delivers photos and movie clips that are packed with detail. From the street to the studio, the EOS 7D Mark II performs in every photographic situation. Its speed and precision make it ideal for sport and action, while its low light capabilities and built-in GPS make it a great choice for those who like to travel and engage wit the surrounding scenery capturing pictures to remember for a lifetime \nWeather sealing\nWhen conditions take a turn for the worse, carry on shooting with confidence. Weather-sealed controls protect the EOS 7D Mark II against water and dust, and magnesium alloy construction adds durability.\n\nBuilt-in GPS\nThe EOS 7D Mark II can geotag images and movie clips with your exact position wherever you are in the world. Record longitude, latitude, elevation and compass direction as well as coordinated universal time\n\nHigh dynamic range (HDR) mode\nWhen shooting in high-contrast conditions, HDR shooting helps preserve detail in dark shadows and bright highlights. In quick succession the EOS 7D Mark II captures three images at different exposures and blends them together for a natural-looking result straight from the camera\n\nDual memory card slots\nThe EOS 7D Mark II has dual memory card slots, enabling automatic back up of files as you shoot, and extended storage capacity.\nThis camera also won the TIPA Product Award 2015 and the EOISA Award of Best product 205-16 \n\nPrice at current USD to £ Stirling $990 or £800\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/canon-7d-mkii-and-bundle-T3FdI"},

Shoots 4K 24/30P. There are a few little quirks that make this quite a unique camera to shoot with, mainly being the back LCD screen is cracked. Despite this crack, it works perfectly and doesn’t affect visual quality. Basically just a way to get the same camera for cheaper. The autofocus might as well not exist, the 20mm lens is not compatible with continuous Video-AF, and the Tamron lens while very sharp, versatile, and compatible with Continuous AF- has the loudest autofocus motor I’ve ever heard. It’s really something to behold. This camera has Panasonic’s class leading In-Body Image Stabilization, it is legitimately some of the smoothest footage you will ever see without a gimbal. Given that this is a Micro Four-Thirds camera, the crop factor vs full frame equivalents is considerable adding up to about 2.4x when shooting in 4K. Despite its micro 4/3 sensor, it is actually decently capable in low light.\n\nAll this comes together to create a lovely, surprisingly tiny little camera rig that lasts around a day and a half off one charge. This is a great camera for someone looking to get into cinema-style video, emphasizing learning the art of manual focus and run and gun video. I’m including a right angle Micro-HDMI to full size HDMI converter because Micro-HDMI ports are notoriously easy to break, so this alleviates some of the strain of plugging and unplugging it, plus it is protected from hits by the cage. Im also including the “eBay supreme” hdmi capture card. It accepts 4K 60P signals and down-converts them to 1080P thru USB so you can use it as a webcam for streaming.\n\nThe concept of this package is to be as versatile as possible while remaining as tiny as possible. This includes *everything* you need to start filmmaking.\n\nPackage includes:\nLUMIX GX85\nCamvate Universal Camera Cage\nLUMIX 20mm f1.7 with Fotoga Variable ND filter\nViltrox EF-M2 II 0.71x Focal Reducer\nTamron SP AF 17-50mm F2.8\nLUMIX GX85 Battery\nLUMIX GX85 USB Dummy Battery\nAndycine Sony NPF battery plate\nNo-name Sony NPF Battery\nSandisk Extreme Pro 64GB SD Card\nRight-Angle Micro HDMI to HDMI cable with coupler\neBay supreme HDMI Capture Card", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/panasonic-lumix-gx85-2-lenses-speedbooster-and-more-full-kit-Jz2Ef"},

The camera operates perfectly and I am only selling because I am upgrading. This camera provides amazing picture quality, stabilization, and reliability. \n\nI babied this camera from the moment I received it. You can see from the pictures it comes with the original items: box, instruction manual (never opened and never registered), shoulder strap, one DMW-22 black battery, battery charger (not shown in picture but included), body cap, and hotshoe cover.\n\nWhat I love about this camera is the awesome Panasonic colors. It made my videos look like movies with just a little color grading in post. This camera also uses shutter angle, which is very useful. The menu system is super simple and the buttons can be customized for very quick transitions to any settings you want. \n\nThe Lumix S5 also has a dual card slot so you will never lose footage. This camera has never overheated even when using it for an hour straight at 4K. It is also capable of shooting at 6k with an Atmos Ninja (external recorder). This camera is on par with the best Sony cameras for awesome night-time shooting in low light conditions with its full-frame sensor.\n\nThe camera has very minimal wear, as you can see in the photos. You will not be disappointed in this purchase. I always take top care of all my gear. Please note this camera does not come with memory cards or lenses.  \n\nBelow is some more information about the camera. If you have any questions about the camera, please contact me.

Based on a 20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS sensor, notable image quality is possible with enhanced sensitivity for working in a range of lighting conditions. The sensor and image processor also afford quick continuous shooting up to 5 fps for working with moving subjects, as well as UHD 4K video recording at 30p for clear, high-resolution movie playback. Balancing these imaging attributes is an expansive 60x optical zoom lens that provides a 24-1440mm equivalent range, covering wide-angle to super telephoto focal lengths, and is complemented by Dual Detect Vibration Reduction to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharp handheld shooting. An ergonomic body design reminiscent of a DSLR also benefits handling, as well as the incorporation of both a 921k-dot electronic viewfinder and rear 3.0 921k-dot vari-angle LCD. For wireless sharing and remote control of the camera from a mobile device, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC is supported as well as Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. More than just a long-zoom point-and-shoot, the B700 balances both stills and video recording assets, along with intuitive handling and file sharing components.20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS Sensor\n\nA high-resolution 20.2MP 1/2.3 BSI CMOS sensor affords impressive image quality with enhanced sensitivity to benefit working in difficult lighting conditions, along with the ability to record in the NRW raw format for expanded post-production capabilities. The sensor also affords quick performance throughout the camera system, including a continuous shooting rate of up to 5 fps.\n\n60x Optical Zoom Lens\n\nA wide-ranging NIKKOR 60x optical zoom lens provides a 24-1440mm equivalent focal length range that covers wide-angle to super telephoto perspectives, and its range can effectively be doubled through the use of Dynamic Fine Zoom for a total 120x zoom magnification. Dual Detect Vibration Reduction balances this awesome length by compensating for the effects of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting. Additionally, the lens optical design incorporates extra-low dispersion glass to minimize chromatic aberrations and color fringing throughout the zoom range for cleaner, clearer image quality.\n\nUHD 4K Video Recording\n\nIn addition to stills recording, UHD 4K video recording is supported in both 30p and 25p frame rates for clips up to 8 minutes long. Face-priority autofocus is available during recording to maintain sharp focus on detected subjects and 5-axis Hybrid Vibration Reduction can be used to suppress the effects of camera shake that occur while moving when recording. Additionally, rounding out the movie feature-set, the built-in stereo zoom mic automatically changes directivity according to the zoom position for more refined audio quality.\n\nBody Design and Built-In Wi-Fi\n\nThe ergonomic body design resembles a DSLR and incorporates a large grip for more stable shooting.\n\nA 921k-dot electronic viewfinder is available for clear eye-level shooting, which is especially beneficial when working in bright conditions.\n\nThe rear 3.0 921k-dot LCD features a vari-angle design to support working from a range of shooting angles.\n\nAn HDMI port permits connecting the camera directly to an HDTV or 4K TV for high-resolution playback.\n\nOther Camera Features\n\nMultiple Exposure Lighten records multiple shots into one frame to creatively capture moving subjects, such as fireworks.\n\nCreative Mode options let you product artistically-refined imagery in-camera.\n\nSuperlapse movies turn a fast-paced action sequence into a fast-paced video, in-camera.\n\nStandard P/S/A/M settings afford you manual control over exposure settings.\n\nThe included EN-EL23 battery provides up to 350 shots per charge.\n\nIn-camera image editing modes: Copy, D-Lighting, Filter Effects, Quick Effects, Quick Retouch, Skin Softening, and Small Picture.\n\nLanguage support: Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Marathi, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.\n\nUPC: 018208265107\n", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/nikon-coolpix-b700-4k-wi-fi-digital-camera-2DXjV"},

Its compact design combined with a robust set of features makes it an ideal instrument for capturing high-resolution images and video in any light conditions.\n\nIncluded in this sale are a battery, cap, and a custom-designed Really Right Stuff (RRS) base plate specifically for the A7S II. The RRS base plate, precision-machined from solid blocks of 6061-T6 aluminum, adds to the camera's stability and prevents any twisting during use. It's completely compatible with the 1.5\" RRS Dovetail Standard and includes a custom machined 1/4\"-20 threaded, captive-style mounting screw that threads into the camera's tripod mounting socket. This modular system can be further expanded with a dedicated vertical L-component for even greater flexibility.\n\nPlease note there is a minor intermittent issue where the camera might detect something attached to the accessory shoe, but this doesn't affect the shoe's operation.

SHUTTER COUNT: ~79,000. Few signs of wear on the edges, minor scratches on the rear screen protector, and noticeable scratches on the top LCD screen. Pictures included to show the extent of wear. Includes genuine Nikon EN-EL18a and EN-EL18c batteries, genuine Nikon MH-26a battery charger and power cable, one XQD card case, original box, manuals, warranty card, Sony XQD & SD card reader (MRW-E90) and required USB cable (USB A to USB Micro B Super Speed), two longer battery chamber covers (BL-5), one normal size battery chamber cover, body cap, and original Nikon D5 camera strap. This camera was originally purchased from B&H in February of 2017.\n\n\nCamera Description:\n\nEXPEED 5, Nikon’s most powerful processor ever\nMasterful image quality\nThe sheer imaging power of the D5 is exhilarating. With its Nikon developed 20.8MP FX-format CMOS sensor, the D5 is the highest resolution full-frame Nikon flagship ever and ready for your next challenge. Nikon's superior image processor has been updated to EXPEED 5 to harness the power of this remarkable new sensor, and a second processor has been added just for autofocus. All of the exquisite detail and textures, vibrant colors and rich tonality delivered by NIKKOR lenses is captured in flawless precision, even in extreme low light.\n\nStay On Top Of Your Game\nThe speed to capture decisive moments\nWhen you hear the D5 shooting at full speed—12 fps with fulltime AF and AE, 14 fps with fixed focus and AE with mirror up—you know the game has changed. For the first time in a Nikon DSLR, a second processor is dedicated solely to autofocus operation and computing. A new shutter and mirror sequencing mechanism nearly eliminates blackout time and mirror slap for bright, consistent views during high-speed capture. EXPEED 5 and a high performance buffer handle up 200 NEF (RAW) and/or Large JPEG images during one high-speed burst—enough to cover an entire 100m sprint without taking your finger off the shutter release button. The new 180K RGB Advanced Scene Recognition System pulls it all together and ensures every shot has optimal exposure.\n\nCapture Images That Defy The Odds\nNikon's fastest, most accurate AF system yet.\nThe D5 ushers in a new era of autofocus with the Multi-CAM 20K AF sensor module. It uses 153 focus points with 99—yes 99—cross-type sensors and a fully dedicated AF processor, and it works in near darkness (EV -4). Small subjects moving at high speed, even in low light, can be tracked with remarkable precision. The system is configurable in 153-, 72- and 25-point coverage when used with Continuous AF. All 153 points are compatible with AF NIKKOR lenses f/5.6 or faster, and 15 central points work with an effective aperture of f/8. Whether you're shooting a high-speed race or A-listers on the red carpet, the D5 has you covered.\n\nMoviemaking Flexibility\n4K UHD video in light others wouldn't dare\nFor the first time in a full-frame Nikon DSLR, record 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) video with dot-by-dot readout for maximum image quality. Capture 3840 x 2160 at 30/25/24p with an angle of view approx. 1.5x lens focal length, or record Full HD 1080 video at 60/30/24p. Shoot stunning 4K UHD Time-lapse, right in camera. Auto ISO handles smooth lighting transitions from ISO 200 to the sensitivity of your choice (all the way up to Hi-5). Enjoy all the professional video capabilities of D4S and D810—simultaneous external and internal recording, Flat Picture Control, Zebra Stripes, a built-in stereo microphone with 20-step increment adjustments and so much more. Combine the D5's low light capabilities and the versatility of NIKKOR lenses, and your next video project is bound to be acclaimed.\n\nA Smooth Operator\nIncorporating feedback from the field, the D5 is engineered to reduce the stress factors of shooting all day. Improved ergonomics and an expanded illuminated button layout put key controls at your fingertips. A high resolution XGA Touchscreen LCD with a smartphone-like interface makes it easy to select AF points or Spot White Balance in Live View, swipe through shots, pinch to zoom, edit file names and more. New double XQD card slots easily handle the camera's incredible burst shooting capacity and keep the buffer cleared. All of this in a light and durable magnesium-alloy body with extensive weather sealing.", "item_url": "https://www.gearfocus.com/products/nikon-d5-xqd-version-20-mp-digital-slr-camera-body-9yviX"},
